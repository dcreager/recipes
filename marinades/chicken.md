# Chicken marinade

This is a baseline, I usually wing it and tweak things a bit.

## Ingredients

- ½ cup soy sauce
- ½ cup water
- 1 lemon, juiced
- 1 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp red wine vinegar
- ¼ tsp sriracha
- 1 clove garlic
- ¼ tsp pepper

## Directions

1. Mix everything together and add some chicken.
2. Marinate at least 2 hours, preferrably overnight, turning once.
