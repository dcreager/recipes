h/t [this guy](http://www.slovakcooking.com/2010/recipes/hungarian-goulash/)

## Ingredients

- 2 lbs beef chuck (cubed)
- 1 large green bell pepper
- 1 large red bell pepper
- 3 tomatoes
- 4-6 scallions
- 1 large yellow onion
- 4 cloves garlic
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- Hungarian paprika
- cayenne pepper
- red pepper
- ground black pepper
- salt
- caraway (ground is better)
- marjoram

## Directions

1. Heat up oil in a large frying pan.  Brown meat on all sides for 5-10 minutes.

2. Remove the meat, leaving behind the brewing sauce.  Add peppers, onions,
   garlic, caraway, salt, pepper, paprika, and tomato paste.  Brown for 5-10
   minutes.

3. Add red pepper.  Don't add too much â€” it will concentrate as the stew
   thickens!

4. Put the meat back in and add enough water to cover it.  Bring to a boil and
   then reduce heat to low.

5. Cover and wait at least 3 hours.  Aim for a "one second gap" thickness.  Just
   as the sauce is starting to get ready and the meat is nice and tender, add
   the marjoram.

Serve over rice or (preferrably!) over steamed dumplings.
